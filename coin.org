* Why coin?
If you'd like to keep track of your groceries, use coin.

* How does coin work?
First, coins pulls the UPC and price info off of the given Walmart
receipt.

Then, coin matches the name with the UPC (Yes! No more scratching your
head against seemingly random Walmart abbreviations for items!) using
a scraper

Finally, it stores your shopping trip in a database.

* Dependencies
+ Python
+ PyQt6
+ pytesseract
+ OpenCV (On Python)
+ PIL
+ Selenium (undetected)
